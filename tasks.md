# TestFlight PM - Product Roadmap & Tasks

## üéØ Product Vision

**TestFlight PM** is an intelligent automation tool that bridges the gap between TestFlight feedback and development workflow. It automatically processes TestFlight data (crashes, bugs, screenshots, user feedback) and creates actionable development tasks in GitHub Issues or Linear, complete with repository context and code analysis.

## üìä Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- Manual monitoring of TestFlight feedback is time-consuming
- Context switching between TestFlight, code repositories, and issue trackers
- Losing valuable user feedback due to poor visibility
- Difficulty correlating crashes/bugs with specific code changes
- Inconsistent issue creation and prioritization

**Target Users:**
- iOS Development Teams (Primary)
- Product Managers tracking app quality
- DevOps engineers managing release cycles
- Individual developers with multiple apps
